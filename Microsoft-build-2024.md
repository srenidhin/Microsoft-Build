### Azure AI
 
### GPT-4o

Successor to GPT-4 and Top performing model right now. No lag in-between prompt and answer based on the demo video.

**Demo 1** : Demo where screen was shared with AI and A game session of Minecraft was running, player was new. Player requested GPT to walk him through the game to get started. GPT perceives everything on the screen and guides user to play the game and complete objectives while surviving.

Turn any application into a full duplex multi modal canvas 

**Demo 2** : User has webcam turned on, Shows his current footwear and asks GPT if they are enough for trekking, GPT identifies footwear (Not sure if it is from the website) and goes on to explain about it. User interrupts GPT (Very responsive and in context like having a normal conversation) and asks it to choose the best footwear for his current trek and add it to the cart on the website on his behalf. Seamlessly, switches languages in the same conversation while maitaining context of the conversation.

## Secure Future Initiatives

> "Secure by design, Secure by default, Secure Operations"

**Modern day Threats** :

- Exploiting chains of trust
- Hack at the source i.e., Developers. 
- Defenders think in List, Attackers think in Graph
- Security-first mindset
- Github provides Security dependency review

**Protect identities and Secrets** :

- Secret Scanning in code files
- Use managed Identities to trouble-free automatic password rotation
- Treat Nonprod environment same security as Prod environment, Don't expose passwords in Nonprod

**Protect Engineering Systems** :

- Supply chain attack, Investing backdoors to cash out where it matters (XZ Utils, Solarwinds)
- Using development repos, demos, builds, pipelines to understand the system in-n-out. Better to delete those once finalized. 
- Get rid of old systems which have access to systems, maybe credentials. If unused, better to get rid of it.
